# string to link ytb
 A simple program to transform a list of videos strings - like a big query - into a list of their links using Google Youtube Search API

To use the program you'll need to install python, then the module requests

```pip install requests```

Then put all the songs you want to get the links into `songs.txt` 

Then run:
```python bin/main.py```

And once it's done, go into links.txt and all the links are here !

Feel free to modify it! - You can create any fork you want -
